## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? During the months of to July you have a higher chance to have a successful outcome.December is not a good month for a theater launch.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? About 33% of all plays fail. If the play has a goal of over $20,000 there is a higher chance of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset? The amount of plays higher than $20,000 doesn't provide enough substantial data points to come to a conclusion as solidified as the other categories due to the total volume of plays conducted.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Similar to outcomes by launch date, we could make a graph that shows which years have been more successful than others. Another interesting factor would be if we knew how long the plays went on for to determine their success.
