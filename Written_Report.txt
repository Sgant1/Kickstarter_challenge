### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? During the months of to July you have a higher chance to have a successful outcome.December is not a good month for a theater launch.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? 50% of all plays fail. There is a higher chance of success if the goal is less than $5,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?The amount of plays higher than 20,000 doesn't provide enough data points to be unbiased.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Similar to outcomes by launch date, we could make a graph that shows which years have been more successful than others. Another interesting factor would be if we knew how long the plays went on for to determine their success.
